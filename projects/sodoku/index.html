        <h1>Game introduction</h1>
        <p>Sudoku (数独 sūdoku, digit-single) (/suːˈdoʊkuː/ (About this sound listen), /-ˈdɒ-/, /sə-/,
           originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
          The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of
          the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions")
          contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid,
          which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.</br>

          Completed games are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents
          of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row,
          column, or any of the nine 3×3 subregions of the 9x9 playing board.(Ref <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sodoku Wiki</a>)</p>

        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p><strong>For the board:</strong>  click on the empty space on the board, a popup panel with 9 number
           and 3 additional spaces will appear. Click on the number will fill the board with it.
           If you want to remove the number you just fills in, click on the white space on the panel
           will remove it. The blue space will fill the board with blue meanning you are not
            sure about it and the green color will fill the board with green meaning you are sure about it.
            The color space is just some additional mark for yourself, feel free to use it or not </br>
          <strong>For the buttons:</strong> the <strong>Check</strong> button is used when you finished your filling of the board, and check for if
          you fill all the empty space with correct number, if there is wrong number, it will be marked with red.
          The <strong>Reset</strong> button will reset the game to the initial state.
          The <strong>Clear</strong> button is used after you did a check, it will empty all the red mark space.
          The <strong>New</strong> button is used to create a new Sodoku game.
          If you finished the sodoku game successfully, an alert box will popup, stating you have finished the game successfully.
